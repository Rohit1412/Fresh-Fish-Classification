# Fresh Fish Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aims to classify fresh fish images into various species using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist in automating the process of identifying fish species, which is crucial for environmental monitoring, sustainable fishing practices, and fish farming management.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation to enhance model training.
- Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- A user-friendly interface for uploading new fish images and receiving instant classification results.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd fresh_fish_classification
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
After installing the project dependencies, you can run the classification model using the following command:
```
python classify_fish.py --image_path <path_to_your_fish_image>
```
Replace `<path_to_your_fish_image>` with the actual path to the fish image you want to classify.
